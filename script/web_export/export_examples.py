"""Write the example input files the site offers for download.

A visitor who has never exported an OTU table cannot guess what the upload
boxes want, so each input route gets a small real file to open or run:

    examples/atlas_asv_example.fasta   two 300-base reads spanning V4, for the atlas search
    examples/otu_table_example.tsv     two samples keyed by SILVA 138.2 OTU id
    examples/rep_seqs_example.fasta    the same two samples as amplicon sequences
    examples/asv_table_example.tsv     ... and their ASV count table

The two samples are the CRC control and case the page already offers as
one-click examples, so a file uploaded here scores the same community.

Reads are cut the way an amplicon run would produce them: the 300 bases that
follow the 515F primer site of the OTU's reference sequence. The atlas reads
also carry two substitutions each, so the search reports a realistic identity
below 100% rather than an exact copy of the database. Both were checked with
vsearch against `atlas_refseqs.fasta` using the server's flags: each returns
exactly one OTU, its source.

For the dysbiosis route, OTUs whose reference sequence lacks the primer site
are left out, and OTUs whose reads are identical are merged into one ASV, as a
denoiser would. The FASTA route therefore sees a slightly smaller community than
the table route and its score can differ a little; that is how real data behave.

Standard library only. Run after export_assets.py, because it reads the vsearch
databases that script writes and refreshes the manifest it writes:
