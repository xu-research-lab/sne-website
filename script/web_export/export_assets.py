"""Post-process the atlas arrays and build the download page's artefacts.

Run this after `script/atlas_export.ipynb` and after `export_dysbiosis.py`.
It reads what those wrote -- it never recomputes a layout -- and adds the
things the site serves but the research notebooks have no reason to produce.

    nbr_sne_sim.f16.bin     cosine similarity, float16
    sne.f16.bin             the embedding matrix, float16

    download/manifest.json  sizes and checksums for the download page

The phylogenetic neighbours are not here: `export_phylo_neighbours.py` reads
the SILVA tree and writes them as float16 itself.

Why halve the similarities: the array is 2.8 MB as float32 and compress
badly, because a cosine to four decimals is close to incompressible. One byte
per value was the first attempt and is not enough resolution -- see
`quantise_similarity` for what that costs on these numbers.

The write into `meta.json` is additive: every key the notebook put there is
kept, and re-running this script replaces the two entries it owns rather than
duplicating them.
